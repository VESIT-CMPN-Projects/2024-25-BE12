# Visual Digital Twin of Medical Solutions for a specialized Gen AI Agentic Model 


This project is an contribution to an Major Industrial Project , involves training a **Stable Diffusion** model on a custom dataset of to generate realistic human images based on textual descriptions as well as performing various operations on it.  
The trained model is integrated into a **Tornado-based web application**, enabling users to submit text prompts and receive AI-generated images in response.

## Key Features
- Fine-tuned **Stable Diffusion** pipeline.
- **Tornado** framework integration for fast API access.
- Realistic human image generation from text inputs.
- Designed for healthcare applications.

## Main Technologies
- Stable Diffusion
- PyTorch
- Tornado (Python web framework)
- OpenCV / Image Processing

## Use Case Example
- Generate an image of a patient based on user input.
- Analyze generated images for skin exposure.
- Superimpose virtual medical devices intelligently.
